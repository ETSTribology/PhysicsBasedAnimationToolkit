    "# Workshop 1: [pbatoolkit](https://pypi.org/project/pbatoolkit/)'s FEM module\n",
    "\n",
    "This first workshop on FEM aims to help the reader:\n",
    "- explore/analyze FEM quantities/operators\n",
    "- familiarize themself with our [Physics Based Animation Toolkit](https://github.com/Q-Minh/PhysicsBasedAnimationToolkit)'s Python interface\n",
    "\n",
    "Start by installing the required dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt` on the command line. FEM relies on having meshed geometries at hand, hence we recommend finding clean surface mesh geometry and then using our [mesh processing scripts](/python/tools/mesh/) to tetrahedralize them, if you don't already have access to meshes. You can download surface meshes on [Thingi10K](https://ten-thousand-models.appspot.com/), [TurboSquid](https://www.turbosquid.com/) or other.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are interested in profiling calls to FEM operations, also download the [Tracy profiling server](https://github.com/wolfpld/tracy/releases/tag/v0.10), run `tracy.exe` and connect to this process."

    "## Constructing FEM meshes\n",
    "\n",
    "From the input mesh geometry, construct an FEM mesh using `pbatoolkit`. Start by exploring the API of the FEM module of `pbatoolkit`. Then, try constructing meshes of different shape function orders on either of line, triangle, and/or tetrahedral meshes. You can do the same for regular geometry (rectangles and boxes) if you want.\n",
    "\n",
    "`pbatoolkit` expects input matrix data in column major storage (i.e. `order='F'` in [numpy](https://numpy.org/)) and uses double precision floating point numbers as scalars, and 64-bit signed integers as indices. Vertex positions are generally packed in matrix columns, and similarly for cell indices. This format is generally compatible with other packages' APIs, using a no-copy transpose operation (i.e. a row-major `order='C'` matrix with vertex positions in rows has the same memory layout as a column-major `order='F'` matrix with vertex positions in columns).\n",
    "\n",
    "Use Python's `help` command on `pbatoolkit`'s mesh instance, and check that you can access its nodes' positions, its elements' nodal indices, its dimensionality, element type, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Note that the FEM mesh and the geometric mesh do NOT share the same element indices. Both the FEM and geometric mesh have the same number of elements, and they are ordered in exactly the same way, but the geometric mesh's array of vertex positions does not necessarily correspond to the FEM mesh's array of node positions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Keep an eye on how the number of FEM nodes changes when the mesh's shape function order changes, and the computational cost of constructing higher order meshes. Visualize the FEM mesh's nodes on top of the geometric mesh using `polyscope`."
